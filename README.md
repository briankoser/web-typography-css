# web-typography-css
A stylesheet based on Richard Rutter's book [Web Typography](http://www.book.webtypography.net/). Not a replacement for purchasing the book, merely a reference and template. Absolutely buy the book, it's great.

- web-typography.css has just the styles
- web-typography-notes.css has explanations and page number references
